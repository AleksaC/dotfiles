# dotfiles

My dotfile collection.

I use [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal emulator with
[zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell). To get extra productivity I added
in a few [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) plugins.

For quick edits I turn to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with minimalistic
configuration and no plugins.

My OS of choice is Ubuntu 18.04 and I don't see that changing in forseable future,
so I made `setup.sh` to quickly get me up and running on a clean install.

This configuration is simple and I've mostly settled on it some time ago as I've shifted my focus towards things that [scale](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2020/01/17/doing-things-that-scale/).

# dotfiles

My dotfile collection.

My OS of choice is Ubuntu 20.04. I manage my OS configuration using an 
[ansible playbook](https://github.com/AleksaC/personal-ansible).

I use [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) terminal emulator with
[zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) as a default shell. To get extra
productivity I added in a few [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) plugins.

For quick edits, I turn to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with minimalistic configuration.

This configuration is simple, and I've mostly settled on it some time ago as I've
shifted my focus towards things that
[scale](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2020/01/17/doing-things-that-scale/).
